Docker CLI Toolkit
===

An interactive CLI tool for closing multiple docker containers / images at once.

### Installation
In order to use this script, [docker](https://www.docker.com/) needs to be installed and started. You can start it with:   
```sudo systemctl start docker```

The script can be placed in any directory but has to have the proper rights:    
```chmod u+x rm-all.sh```

No further installation is needed :) 

If you have any questions or encounter any issues, don't hesitate to open an issue!
